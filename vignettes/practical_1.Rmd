## Exercise

Develop a flow diagram for a model of Tuberculosis transmission in the United Kingdom. The model should aim to answer one or more of the following study questions. 

1. What impact would a new point of care test for TB have? 
1. An improved Tuberculosis vaccine has been developed, who should recieve it and when?
1. A new Tuberculosis treatment is available which reduces treatment time from 6 months to 3 months. Forecast the long term impact of this on incidence rates
1. Tuberculosis screening for all new migrants has been introduced, is this strategy likely to suceed.

In your groups read through the Tuberculosis facts below, choose a study question, and discuss the model structure that would be appropriate to investigate it. Remember that your model should aim to be as parsimonious as possible and therefore should not try to capture the full complexity of Tuberculosis transmission in the UK. To get you started here is a flow diagram for a basic model of Tuberculosis transmission (based on [@Brooks-Pollock2010]):

## Tuberculosis facts

### Natural History of Tuberculosis

- Mode of transmission
- Latent/Active disease
- Pulmonary/non-Pulomonary TB
- Smear positive/Smear negative
- Age specific mortality rates

### Known risk factors

- HIV
- Diabetes
- Smoking
- Low socioeconomic status
- High density living

### Treatments, vaccines and tests

#### Treatments

- DOTs
- Drugs available (timelime)
- Drug resistant TB

#### Vaccines

- BCG vaccine
- Vaccines in development
### Tuberculosis globally

- Global incidence
- Global mortality
- Co-epidemic with HIV

### Tuberculosis in the UK

- Incidence in the UK
- Incidence rates
- UK born/non-UK born
- Urban areas/non-Urban areas

                           "Detail"),
             split.tables = 150,
             justify = "lllll"
             
             )
