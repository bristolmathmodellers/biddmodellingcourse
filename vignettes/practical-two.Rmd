1. Understand the dynamics of the SEIR model in detail.
1. Understand the impact of risk group stratification on model dynamics.

1. Investigate the complex dynamics of a more realistic SHLIR model (10 minutes) .
1. Explore the parameter space of multiple models and try to understand some of the general implications of model structures on dynamics (20 minutes).
1. Session wrap up (5 minutes)

# Solutions

The practical solutions are in **bold**, all code has been completed and the exercise models have been simmulated and summarised.

# Set up 

In order to more systematically explore the parameter space of multiple models we have provided an interactive interface. Start the interactive interface by running the following in `R`.

```{r run-exploreidmodels, eval = FALSE}
if (!library(shiny, logical.return = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("shiny")
  library(shiny)
}
shiny::runGitHub("exploreidmodels", "seabbs")
```

If having problems running the application then talk to an instructor and/or try the hosted web version ([http://seabbs.co.uk/shiny/exploreidmodels/](http://seabbs.co.uk/shiny/exploreidmodels/)).


Use this interface to explore the some of the model that have already been discussed and to answer the following ec. Instructions for using the interactive interface can be found in the about section of the application. 

# Exercises

##1. A Simple SEIR Model of Tuberculosis (TB)

As a first exercise, we are going to explore the simple SEIR model, as seen in the design a model practical, in R. For reference the SEIR model flow diagram seen in the first practical's solutions.[@Brooks-Pollock2010] The equations below are a translation of this into `R` code.

![`r pretty_figref("model_diag", "An SEIR model of TB transmission, including simple demographic processes")`](./resources/SEIR_flow_diag.png)


### Explore

Model dynamics are parameter dependent. Even in a simplistic model like the one outlined above parameter values can greatly alter the dynamics. Answer the following questions by varying the parameters and rerunning the model. 

1. What is the impact of adding demographic processes (births and deaths)?
    

1. What happens when the transmission rate (beta) is reduced to 0.5?




1. What happens as the rate of recovery is increased?





##2. Add High and Low Risk Compartments

To make the SEIR model slightly more realistic, and therefore better able to capture the observed dynamics of TB, we add a second latent population (as discussed in the solutions for practical 1). This change can be seen in the model flow diagram (`r pretty_figref("SHLIR-diag")`). Go back to [practical 1](https://bristolmathmodellers.github.io/biddmodellingcourse/articles/practical_1.html) if you need a refresher for the motivation behind this. We have also added reinfection for the low risk latent population.

![`r pretty_figref("SHLIR-diag", "An SHLIR model of TB transmission, including simple demographic processes")`](./resources/SHLIR_flow_diag.png)

### Explore

1. What has the impact of adding the second latent population been?




##3. A more realistic SHLIR model flow diagram 

The most complex model supported by the interactive interface, this is a more realistic model that might be used in research.
The SHLIR model flow diagram (`r pretty_figref("complex_SHLIR_diag")`) includes: risk groups, treatment, and reinfection for those who have recovered from active disease. Whilst many realistic TB models use age structure this is not included here (if you are interested in discussing how you would include this talk to your instructors or contact [me](https://www.samabbott.co.uk/)). For simplicity we have assumed that it is possible to be born into both populations. For the motivation behind this model see 
[practical 1](https://bristolmathmodellers.github.io/biddmodellingcourse/articles/practical-one.html). 

![`r pretty_figref("complex_SHLIR_diag", "A realistic SHLIR model of TB transmission, including simple demographic processes")`](./resources/SHLIR_real_flow_diag.png)

`r pretty_figref("complex_SHLIR_diag")` does not include the interaction between the high and low risk subgroups as this is through the force of infection. The force of infection is defined as,

\[ \lambda_i = \beta \sum_{j = L, H}M_{ij}I_j \]

Where $\lambda_i$ is the force of infection in each risk group ($i = L, H$) and $M_{LH}$ is the mixing rate between risk groups. It is assumed that within group contact rates are equivalent and defined such that,

\[ M_{ii} = 1 \]

It is also assumed that the between group contact rates are defined as (where $i \neq j$), 

\[ M_{ij} = 0.1 \]

### Explore


1. What happens when one group has a much higher transmission probability (use the default settings for all other parameters), compared to when the transmission probability is the same for both groups?


1. What is the impact of varying the mixing between high and low risk groups for the above scenario?




##3. Explore model dynamics

- The interactive interface allows for exploration of multiple other models, using it can you identify some commonalities between different models? What generalisations can you draw from these commonalities.
